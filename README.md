# AzurePercept-BoundingBoxCoordinate-To-SpeechToTextinPowerApps-Plus-PowerBI
Using the Camera/Vision module, extracting the X coordinate for the bounding box, sending over Stream Analytics to chart in PowerBI, and then sending to PowerApps to connect with TextToSpeech to play audio
# Overview
This repository will document and have instructions on how to :
     - Use the Azure Percept Dev Kit to detect and draw a bounding box around a person
     - Parse the bounding box coordinates in Azure Stream Analytics and send that to both blob storage and to PowerBI
     - Plot the x coordinate in PowerBI to watch in real time the size of the bounding box increase/decrease as your arm moves in and out.
     - Create a PowerApp that plays back audio to read back Microsoft Translater API call to read back x coordinate.
     - Map x coordinates to music notes 
# Azure Percept Dev Kit
     - https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/azure-percept/
     - Percept Setup instructions will be here.  TBD
# Stream Analytics
      - Stream Analytics code to parse out JSON and identify X coordinate will be here.
      
      - When I first passed all the data from my Percept into PowerBI over streamanalytics I would get "array" instead of the bounding box coordinates.
      - I then tried the following code in the Stream Analytics query which worked nicely to parse out the individual bounding box coordinate values.
SELECT
    Percept.ArrayValue.label,
    Percept.ArrayValue.confidence,
    GetArrayElement(Percept.ArrayValue.bbox, 0) AS bbox0,
    GetArrayElement(Percept.ArrayValue.bbox, 1) AS bbox1,
    GetArrayElement(Percept.ArrayValue.bbox, 2) AS bbox2,
    GetArrayElement(Percept.ArrayValue.bbox, 3) AS bbox3,
    Percept.ArrayValue.bbox,
CAST (udf.main(Percept.ArrayValue.timestamp) as DateTime) as DETECTION_TIMESTAMP,
    Percept.ArrayValue.timestamp
INTO
    "PowerBI Report Name"
FROM
    "IOTHUB connection" as event
    CROSS APPLY GetArrayElements(event.Neural_Network) AS Percept
WHERE
    CAST(Percept.ArrayValue.confidence as Float) > 0.6
      
      Plan for this section
          - Document output in PowerBI, and upload a PBIX file of output example.
          - Document steps I used and documentation I read to come up with the Stream Analytics query.
          - Document how to create inputs from IOT HUB and output to PowerBI stream analytics - and some tips to make it work if changes are made to the query.

# PowerBI setup
      - Instructions to connect to PowerBI to monitor data in visuals will be here.
# PowerApps Setup
      - Instructions to setup PowerApps and connect to Microsoft Translator Speech to Text will be here.

# A fun adventure!!
    - I will update daily as I learn more üòÅ
